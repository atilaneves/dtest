dtest
=============

###**Deprecated**: No longer needed with the latest version of [unit-threaded](https://github.com/atilaneves/unit-threaded)

Utility using [unit-threaded](https://github.com/atilaneves/unit-threaded)
to run all unit tests in a list of directories. This was written because,
although [unit-threaded](https://github.com/atilaneves/unit-threaded) can
scan and run all unit tests in a given set of modules, those modules need
to be manually specified, which can be tedious. The reason for that is
that D packages are just directories and the compiler can't
read the filesystem at compile-time, so this executable does that
to write a D source file which it runs using `rdmd`.

This means `rdmd` must be installed for this program to work.

    Usage: dtest [options] [test1] [test2]...
    Options:
        -h/--help: help
        -t/--test: add a test directory to the list. If no test directories
        are specified, then the default list is ["tests"]
        -u/--unit_threaded: directory location of the unit_threaded library
        -d/--debug: print debug information
        -I: extra include directories to specify to rdmd
        -f/--file: file name to write to
        -s/--single: run the tests in one thread
        -d/--debug: print debugging information from the tests
        -l/--list: list all tests but do not run them
        -n/--nodub: do not run dub fetch to get unit-threaded
        -c/--compiler: Set the compiler (default is dmd)

    This will run all unit tests encountered in the given directories
    (see -t option). It does this by scanning them and writing a D source
    file that imports all of them then running that source file with rdmd.
    By default the source file is a randomly named temporary file but that
    can be changed with the -f option. If the unit_threaded library is not
    in the default search paths then it can be specified with the -u option.
    If the --nodub option is not used, `dtest` defaults to using dub
    to fetch unit-threaded so that the library need not be downloaded nor
    have its location specified manually.
    If any command-line arguments exist they will be forwarded to the
    unit_threaded library and used as the names of the tests to run. If
    none are specified, all of them are run.

    To run all tests located in a directory called "tests":

    dtest

    To run all tests in dir1, dir2, etc.:

    dtest -t dir1 -t dir2...

    To run tests foo and bar in directory mydir:

    dtest -t mydir mydir.foo mydir.bar

    To run tests foo and bar in directory mydir in a single thread:

    dtest -t mydir -s mydir.foo mydir.bar
